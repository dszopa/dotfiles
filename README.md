My unix-based-system dotfiles

## Homebrew Packages

Install [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew)

```bash
# Leaving a machine
brew leaves > leaves.txt

# Fresh installation
xargs brew install < leaves.txt
```

Rather than including everything in my leaves.txt, I prefer to explicitly
add / remove packages as needed.
